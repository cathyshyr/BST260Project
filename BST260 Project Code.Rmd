**Baseball Prospectus**

To calculate `WARP`, [Baseball Prospectus](http://legacy.baseballprospectus.com/sortable/.) uses three proprietary statistics: Batting Runs Above Replacement (BRAR), Fielding Runs Above Replacement (FRAR), and Pitching Runs Above Replacement (PRAR).

The three numbers are added and divided by the number of runs per win that season, which is another proprietary number. According to [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Wins_Above_Replacement_Player.), this number is around 10.

Baseball Prospectus provides player, team, and year-specific WAR statistics. Data (as shown above) are displayed annually from 1871 to 2017 with a drop down menu for user selection. 

To scrape year-specific data, we vectorized over the range of years and used the function `set_values` and `submit_form` to automate the selection process and extracted the table of interest by identifying the corresponding `html_node`. 


```{r Baseball Prospectus, eval = FALSE}
url_batting <- "http://legacy.baseballprospectus.com/sortable/index.php?cid=2022181"
url_pitching <- "http://legacy.baseballprospectus.com/sortable/index.php?cid=1931167"

prospectus <- function(year, url){
  year = as.character(year)
  pgsession <- html_session(url)
  pgform <- html_form(pgsession)[[3]]
  
  #Fill in selection form
  filled_form <-set_values(pgform,
                           "year" = year
  )
  
  #Submit selection form
  d <- submit_form(session = pgsession, form = filled_form)
  dat <- d %>%
    html_nodes("table") %>%
    .[[5]] %>%
    html_table(header = Truth)
  dat
}

#Submit Year = X for X in [1871, 2017] to obtain year-specific data
prospectus_batting <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1871:2017, prospectus, url = url_batting))
prospectus_pitching <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1871:2017, prospectus, url = url_pitching))

#Reformat data 
prospectus_pitching <- read.csv("prospectus_pitching_full.csv")
prospectus_batting <- read.csv("prospectus_batting_full.csv")

prospectus_pitching_small <- prospectus_pitching[, c("NAME", "TEAM", "YEAR", "PWARP")]
names(prospectus_pitching_small) <- c("Name", "Team", "Year", "WARP")
prospectus_batting_small <- prospectus_batting[, c("NAME", "TEAM", "YEAR", "BWARP")]
names(prospectus_batting_small) <- c("Name", "Team", "Year", "WARP")
```

**Baseball Reference**

[Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/) defines `rWAR` as

$$
rWAR = (\mbox{Player_Runs - AvgPlayer_Runs) + (AvgPlayer_runs - ReplacePlayer_runs})
$$

`rWAR` is based on six different components: (1) batting runs, (2) baserunning runs, (3) runs added or lost due to grounding into double plays in double play situations, (4) fielding runs,  (5) positional adjustment runs, and (6) replacement level runs. The first five components are compared against the league average, meaning an "average" league player is assigned a value of zero. It follows that negative numbers correspond to worse than average and positive numbers better than average. These five components make up the first half of the equation. The last component, replacement level runs, makes up the second part of the equation.

Data are provided for each team in different years. Separate tables are displayed for batters and pitchers. The screenshot above provides an example of one of the tables shown for the New York Yankees in 2017. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wangcathy/BST260Project/master/baseballref_screencap.png)

Links to these tables follow a general pattern, so a vector of all the possible links was created. We then looped through all of these links to grab the tables from each page. Final touches were made to get the datasets into the right format.

```{r Baseball Reference, eval = FALSE}
teams <- unique(Teams$franchID)

### Exploratory Analysis
What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?

####Combine data sets

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Read in BBProspectus data and remove extraneous columns
BBProspectus <- read.csv("prospectus.csv")
BBProspectus <- BBProspectus %>%
  select(c(-X, -W))

#Read in BBProspectus data and remove extraneous columns
BBReference <- read.csv("BBReference.csv")
BBReference <- BBReference %>%
  rename(rWAR = WAR) %>%
  select(c(-X, -source, -W))


#Inner join BB Ref and BB Pros for a complete data set
data <- inner_join(BBReference, BBProspectus, by = c("franchID", "yearID"))

#Join combined data with true number of wins in Lahman's dataset to create wide data set 
team_sub <- Teams %>%
  select(yearID, franchID, W)  %>%
  rename(Truth = W)
data_wide <- left_join(data, team_sub, by = c("franchID", "yearID"))

#Gather into long data format
data_long <- gather(data_wide, source, WAR, -c(franchID, yearID))
```


####How well does WAR compare to the true number of wins?

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.align='center'}
data_sum <- data_long %>%
  group_by(yearID, source) %>%
  summarize(sumWAR = sum(WAR))

data_sum %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = yearID, y = sumWAR, group = source)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = source)) +
  ggtitle("Number of Wins vs. Wins by Replacement (WAR) by Year") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Wins")
```

From this plot, it appears that both `rWAR` and `WARP` capture the trend of true wins over time. However, there is a substantial bias because both WAR statistics are hugely underestimating the truth. 

Next, let's build a naive model to capture the effect of WAR on predicting the truth for each of the 3 WAR statistics. 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.align='center'}
#Linear regression for rWAR and WARP, respectively
m1 <- lm(Truth ~ rWAR, data = data_wide)
m2 <- lm(Truth ~ WARP, data = data_wide)

#Make predictions based on model fit
pred <- predict(m1, newdata = data_wide)
pred2 <- predict(m2, newdata = data_wide)

#Wrangle data for plotting
df_predRef <- cbind(data_wide, rWARpred = pred)
a2 <- df_predRef %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarize(sum.rWARpred = sum(rWARpred))

df_predPros <- cbind(data_wide, WARPpred = pred2)
a3 <- df_predPros %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarize(sum.WARPpred = sum(WARPpred))

p <- ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = data_sum[data_sum$source == "Truth", ], aes(x = yearID, y = sumWAR, group = source, color = source)) +
  geom_line(data = a2, aes(x = yearID, y = sum.rWARpred, color = "rWAR Pred")) + 
  geom_line(data = a3, aes(x = yearID, y = sum.WARPpred, color = "WARP Pred")) + 
  ggtitle("Number of Wins vs. Fitted Values from Naive Model by Year") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Wins")
p


a <- data_wide %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarize(sumW = sum(Truth))

RMSE(a$sumW, a2$sum.rWARpred)
RMSE(a$sumW, a3$sum.WARPpred)
```

According to RMSE, `rWAR` is a better predictor than `WARP`. However, we can definitely improve upon the naive model by accounting for the substructure within our data, e.g. team effect, team x year interaction effect, etc.
